This project uses the XAMPP stack to design and develop a Sweet Shop Website that lets users view the shop's information, including all the sweets offered and their prices, descriptions, and images. Furthermore, the website allows admin login to update prices, descriptions, and items offered. 
The website uses a MySQL database to store user and shop information. The front-end comprises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the back-end scripting was done using PHP.
